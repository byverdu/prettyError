# prettyError

By default all major browsers have their own CSS styles for the error messages shown when a form is submitted and some of the fields are empty or with a wrong value.

With this jQuery plugin you can show identical styles for the errors in all major browsers.

In order to have a custom look for the bubbles across all supporting browsers the only option is to suppress the default bubble and implement your own.

### Good to know

The `required` attribute is a must in all the elements that you need to validate.

When you have to validate a group of `<input type="radio" name="group-1">` they must have the same attribute `name`

> WIP, select and empty first option

Within HTML5 you can add an extra layer of validation by using the appropiate value for the `type` attribute used in the `input` [tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input).

Using the required attribute for a group of check boxes fails because when you submit the form the error message pops up for the unchecked boxes.

To solve this issue you need to add/remove the `required` attribute programmatically. This plugin provides an option that lets you pass the problem.

This is how your error messages will look after using this plugin.

### Dependencies
`jQuery` :smile:

# How to use the plugin
> All compiled files can be found under `/dist/**`

You will need `prettyError.min.js` and `prettyError.min.css`

It is really simple, just get select your form with jQuery and call the prettyError method.

`$('myFormSelector').prettyError();`

# Plugin Options.

The plugin is initialized with the following default options:

```javascript
{
  multiCheckbox: {
    enabled: false
  },
  classError: 'prettyError',
  positionMethod: 'after',
  elementError: 'div',
  callToAction: 'button',
  focusErrorOnClick: true,
  fadeOutError: {
    fadeOut: false
  }
}
```
#### multiCheckbox[Object]
Use this option if you need to validate a group of checkboxes.
`disabled by default!!`

```javascript

    multiCheckbox: {
      enabled: true,
      selector: '.commonClassForGroup'
    }
}
```
```html
